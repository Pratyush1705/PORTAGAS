# PORTAGAS
A simple port scanner and OS detector using Python

The application asks user to enter either ip address or url and then
fetches the open and closed ports along with the listed services.
It also finds out the OS of the particular IP address.This application
is a part of my CyberSecurity Project! Thank You !
